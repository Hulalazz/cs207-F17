**Welcome to CS207!**

It is accpeted that computation has emerged as the third pillar of science alongside the 
pillars of theory and experiment.  Computational science is maturing rapidly and has found 
considerable and significant use in supporting scientists from various disciplines (including all 
engineering disciplines, physics, chemistry, finance, biology, and data analysis to name 
a few).  Many burgeoning scientists are still taught to write "a code" for some problem 
and to debug when things look wrong.  Given the ever-increasing complexity of software 
solutions to scientific problems, this old paradigm is no longer tenable.

CS207 is an applications course highlighting the use of software engineering and computer 
science in solving scientific problems. You will learn the fundamentals of developing 
scientific software systems including abstract thinking, the handling of data, and 
assessment of computational approaches: all in the context of good software engineering 
practices.
