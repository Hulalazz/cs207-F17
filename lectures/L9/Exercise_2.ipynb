    "Write a subclass called `Rcircle` of the superclass `Circle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Requirements\n",
    "* Must inherit from `Circle`\n",
    "* Must have it's own constructor.  The constructor accepts the circle radius supplied by the user as its argument.  That is `__init__(self, r)`.\n",
    "* The circle radius must be set in the constructor\n",
    "* The `Rcircle` subclass must reimplement the `radius` function.  It does not make sense for `Rcircle` to inherit the `radius` method from `Circle` since an instance of `Rcircle` doesn't know anything about the coordinates of the circle."
